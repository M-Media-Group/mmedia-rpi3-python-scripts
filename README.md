# M Media scripts

Scripts I use at my company. Included is a script to check space on SD and temperature and email data to admin on a Raspberry Pi, and a script to generate and email an Excel workbook from InstaPy logs.

Install with
`pip install git+https://github.com/mwargan/mmedia-rpi3-python-scripts.git`
